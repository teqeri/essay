      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">	Use of present day technologies can create a disconnection between the user and their personal ties to specifications within a society and their periodic activity. This conviction is reinforced by Garth Daviss Film Lion, via sundry accounts of film techniques.  Lions singular cinematography, which include driven camera shots and movements, faux yet built atmosphere from lighting, and multiple portrayals of mise en scene throughout, are used within the film  to portray technologys disconnective properties. Thus once in unison, Lion truly shows technologys disconnective properties.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">	A very efficacious part in showing the disconnection between Lions Saroo and his family is the montage of abstract cinematic shots that plays after arguably the biggest disconnection of the entire film; of Saroo leaving Lucy to try and find his home in India. During the montage, many extreme shots, such as extreme close up and extreme long shot are prevalent. Just the name of the terminology alone is enough to describe Saroos situation with his happenings after removing Lucy from his life, severing the final link to his societal connections. The most striking section of the montage is a silhouette in soft focus of Saroo holding a bottled drink; which is implied as a beer. As Saroos silhouette looks out to the exceptionally blurred background, the scene portrays the ideal of the blur being how Saroo sees what is happening to him. The more Saroo uses Google Earth, the more it becomes an extension of him. As the map is only shown from a top down perspective, vision from land becomes more and more meaningless. Although the concept seems unbalanced, this is strengthened by the films technique; by blurring the sections that the viewer sees from the world around Saroo. The blurring technique is further used to portray the loss of connection with his adopted home Australia, as he charts more of India. The silhouette plays a role in this, too, as Saroos features do not show on the darkened figure. The audience is only able to identify Saroo from the hair, and hooded jacket he is wearing. These techniques combine to show a conceptual re-creation of what Saroo views out of his own eyes, a vague figure of himself looking over a figment of how the world is perceived from ground view.
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">	An earlier example of disconnection is the very physical disconnection of Saroo with his family. After setting foot on the train that would soon change his life, Saroo was whisked away from the few connections he had established in his early life; his family, and his home. As Saroo mopes about the caged carriage, the cinematography effortlessly shows Saroos emotions change from frustration of being locked in, to acceptance. The camera accentuates on the fact of disconnection when the train stops at a station. Saroo looks out the barred window of the train to see a person sitting in a field, looking to him. As Saroo yells out for help, he is met with a blank response. Strangely, Saroos words do not seem to penetrate through to the person staring into his eyes. This unsettling feeling, now etched into the aura of the longshot creates a removed feeling in the viewer, almost as if they too are isolated from their surroundings and being absorbed into the film. This, mixed with only the audio of the train and Saroos dialogue, allows the film to express Saroo feelings during this moment to the viewer. Confused but accepting, the train passes through a station, where Saroo observes the people there. With the scene jumping to a handheld shot of Saroos view from within the train, the viewer can clearly see the confused and concerned faces of the people at the station. With help from many slight but important film techniques, Lions train scene is able to manifest Saroos feelings of detachment.
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">	A third instance of technology expressing disconnection is the scene after Saroo alights from the train. Surrounded by walls of people, he is sectioned off from his surroundings. Saroo pushes through the people all around him, and eventually makes his way to the ticket booth, where he tries to communicate to the ticket seller. There is, however, a barrier of language that makes it impossible to explain where he is from. As language is harnessed by people, it is very much a technology. In Lion, language is used to prevent Saroo from being able to connect and communicate with people. While Saroo talks to the man in the ticket booth, many film techniques are present to build atmosphere and meaning. The slight use of mise-en-scene shows a glass barrier between the man in the booth and Saroo, along with a few props scattered around the edge of the shot. The camera angle shows an over the shoulder shot of the man, leaving Saroo in the middle of the shot barely peeking over the ledge of the counter. The lighting is quite dim, leaving an ominous tone and foreshadowing Saroos near future. The people behind Saroo are standing out of frame with their shoulders and above being cut out of the frame, leaving them anonymous and giving them an alien or inhuman nature. This amplifies the isolated feeling even more, and verbalizes the ideology of Saroo being all alone, surrounded by those who are unapproachable and uncontactable. This leaves Saroo stuck, and alone. After being waved and pulled away, Saroo enters the city streets of Kolkata.
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">	Over the course of the whole film, Lion shows a large array of the causes of technology. Many of these include a disconnection of a person to either their surroundings or their acquaintances. While technology is seen as an imperative advancement for the betterment of the human race, it can also be viewed negatively, for the hindrances caused by its overlooked flaws. However, these flaws are brought to attention via the use of film techniques during Lion. Film techniques such as well placed camera shots and angles, well adjusted and setup lighting, and powerful use of mise en scene are used throughout the film to show technologys disconnective properties.
